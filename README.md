### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github! My coding journey in a nutshell...

Took a few programming classes (C++ and VB.Net) senior year of college (2012-2013) and I was hooked, but wasn't quite sure the next steps. After some years in jobs that brought me zero joy, I finally decided to look into programming a bit more on my own via online tutorials/programs (2016-2018). Took a break after getting into a job (unrelated to coding) with decent pay as I thought that would be enough. It wasn't. Went back to pursuing programming again in 2020 and finally joined Grand Circus C# After-Hours Program (Oct, 2020 - Mar, 2021). Landed an internship with Rocket Mortgage shortly after and am finally enjoying the type of work that I do. With that being said, I've been slacking on personal projects and upkeep with my [tech blog](https://medium.com/@thestrongdev). Ready to get back into things! Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candgoods/) if you're looking to connect!
