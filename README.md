### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github! My coding journey in a nutshell...

Took a few programming classes (C++ and VB.Net) senior year of college (2012-2013) and I was hooked, but wasn't quite sure the next steps. After some years in jobs that brought me zero joy, I finally decided to look into programming a bit more on my own via online tutorials/programs (2016-2018). Took a break after getting into a sparkly new job (unrelated to coding) then finally went back to pursuing programming again in 2020, which is when I joined Grand Circus C# After-Hours Program (Oct, 2020 - Mar, 2021). Landed an internship with Rocket Mortgage shortly after and am finally enjoying the type of work that I do!
